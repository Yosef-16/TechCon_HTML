            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of 200 technology enthusiasts in San Francisco. 
                What started as a single-track event has grown into one of the world's premier tech conferences, 
                now attracting over 10,000 attendees annually. Over the years, we've expanded to multiple 
                locations worldwide while maintaining our commitment to cutting-edge content and community building.
